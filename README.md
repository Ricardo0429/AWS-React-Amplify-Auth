Boilerplate for web applications based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) including the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) as front-end framework.
- [React-Bootrstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for UI library and styling.
- [Aws-Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/media/quick_start) for secure authentication flow, api calls etc..
- [Rematch](https://rematch.gitbooks.io/rematch/) for state management (a simple wrapper around [Redux](https://redux.js.org)).

The backend needs to be setup on AWS:
- IAM
- Cognito
- S3
- DynamoDB
- CloudFront
